Face Detection using OpenCV  This project focuses on detecting human faces in images and real-time video streams using OpenCV’s Haar Cascade Classifier. The system uses a pre-trained model provided by OpenCV to identify facial features and draw bounding boxes around detected faces.
# Face Detection using OpenCV

This project demonstrates real-time and image-based face detection using OpenCV’s Haar Cascade classifier.

---

## 🧠 Working Principle
- Haar Cascades use a series of simple features to detect objects (in this case, faces) based on contrast differences in images.
- OpenCV provides pre-trained Haar cascades that can quickly detect faces with good accuracy.

---

## 🧩 Features
- Detects faces from images or webcam.
- Uses OpenCV’s pre-trained Haar Cascade model.
- Draws bounding boxes around detected faces.

---

## 📦 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install opencv-python
